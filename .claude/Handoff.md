### Pommora — Session Handoff

 - **Read first at session start.** Maintained via `/handoff` — Session Summary + Lessons Learned + Next Session + Pending Focuses + Fix Log. Shipped history → `History.md`; roadmap → `Framework.md`; branch quirks + hard rules → `CLAUDE.md`; locked decisions → `History.md` + `Guidelines/Paradigm-Decisions.md`.

> ⚡ **CORNERSTONE — must remain; carry into every session, emphasized for the next (Nathan's voice).**

> *"This whole session started because I'm sick of one pattern: you claim something is true, write a plan around that claim, then later review it and find the claim was never true — and we thrash for hours. **That stops. You do NOT guess. You open the file and LOOK AT THE CODE before you assert anything.** A plan built on an unverified claim is a liability, not progress. Treat every doc, every `file:line`, every "it works like X" as a hypothesis until you've read the code that proves it. We caught this AGAIN today — the plan you wrote carried stale line numbers from an old plan, and the audit caught them before they cost us a session. That audit-before-implement step is non-negotiable."*

> Held the line again this session — the lint-config `/tmp` false signal, the `FrontmatterInspector` `onSave` gap, and the "store the collection icon in SQLite" false premise (a new feature, not a storage fix) were all caught by *looking*, not assuming. **Next session: read the code before you plan around it.**

#### Current state (2026-05-30)

Working tree on `main`, green (only the known `PageEditorViewModelTests.debounceCoalescesRapidEdits` editor-timing flake fails). Clean HEAD = `741ca1d`.

#### Session Summary

**Make Relations Real — COMPLETE (Tasks 1–8).** Relations and tiers render as **icon + title** everywhere (no raw IDs / "(missing)"); the grouped pop-out **value picker** works (liquid-glass 2:4, Collection/Set rows pop a side member panel, loose entities below an inset divider, blue `SelectionCheckmark` on selected, multi-select, scroll-on-overflow); inline relation + status editors persist via the reusable `RelationValueEditor`; `FrontmatterInspector` save wired; Page tiers editable inline; the v5 rebuild backfills icons + tier links; the relation lifecycle tolerates undecodable member files + orphan-parent FK on index upsert (the `MemberFileStrip` helper). Reusable inline-edit + picker-hosting capability is documented so the to-be-replaced Item Window isn't load-bearing.

**#45 — per-Collection/Set icon — SHIPPED (TDD'd, code-review CLEAN).** Optional `icon` in the `_pagecollection.json` / `_itemcollection.json` sidecar (source of truth), mirrored into a new `page_collections` / `item_collections` SQLite column (index `currentSchemaVersion` 5→6 forces one rebuild + backfill). The picker renders `container.icon ?? "folder"`. 4 RED-first outcome tests (`CollectionIconTests`): sidecar round-trip ×2, grouped-query reach, full-rebuild survival. Full `PommoraTests` green (997/998).

**Live schema reactivity (#35)** — detail tables read the live `@Observable` Type/Collection, so add/delete-property updates instantly (no reload).

**Docs aligned to code** — Collection/Set sidecar field lists gained `icon`; Domain-Model corrected (collections own their `views` + `icon`, only the property *schema* inherits); the relation-editor doc now reads "handles creation" (post-creation name/icon edit is #34, pending).

Recent commits: `741ca1d` picker render · `dfdf2af` doc align · `3cb1366` icon data layer · `c39e34c` reactivity · `a97bb54` Task 7 · `0ffd76f`/`40165fd` Task 6 · `0b71ca2` Task 5 · `a995e32`/`acebb83` Task 4 · `f1d66f6` Task 8.

#### Lessons Learned

- **TDD is the contract (Nathan-mandated):** no production code without a failing outcome test first — RED → confirm-it-fails-for-the-right-reason → GREEN. A mid-session lapse (model field then a "no-regression" build) was reverted and redone RED-first.
- **Verify, don't guess — paid off repeatedly:** the `FrontmatterInspector` `onSave` gap (silent non-persist) was found by reading code; "store the collection icon in SQLite" was a *new feature + paradigm change*, not a storage fix (collections had no icon field at all) — pushed back, confirmed, built right with the sidecar as truth.
- **`swift format` resolves `.swift-format` by walking up from the file's path.** Linting a file copied to `/tmp/` silently used 2-space defaults → a false "everything's broken" signal; pass `--configuration` when linting out-of-tree. (`IndexBuilder.swift` + `PommoraIndex.swift` were pre-existing non-conformant; the #45 commit carried the reflow.)
- **Layer-confusion check (quirk #18) holds:** a broken-looking UI ≠ broken data; confirm the data directly before blaming the store.

#### Next Session

**Before planning anything, read the code it touches** (see Cornerstone above): look, don't guess; verify every `file:line` and "it works like X" against the source, and ask Nathan when feature intent is ambiguous — *then* plan.

**Picker UIX gate:** the gate was lifted so I could build while Nathan is remote; the grouped value picker is now **ready for Nathan to verify live** when home. The new inline editors were also never clicked-through in the running app — runtime UX unverified.

Three options:
- **A (recommended) — finish the editing loop:** #34 (relation name/icon post-creation edit + mirror propagation) + #51 (Collection/Set icon edit affordance). Completes "the user can fully *manage* relations + container icons." #34 is specced in `Properties.md`; #51 is small.
- **B — consolidate / test-harden:** #44 (detail-view reactivity tests) + #43 (`SelectionCheckmark` → ChipsGallery) + tidy the `upsert*Collection` `schema_version=1` latent gap.
- **C — pivot:** build the next `Framework.md` surface (real Item Window, Page Previews, Agenda surfacing).

#### Pending Focuses

- **#34** — relation name/icon post-creation edit + mirror propagation. Creation is built (`createPairedRelation` + `reverseIcon`); `renameOneSide` exists (name, one side); no icon-edit, no propagating-edit loop, no UI.
- **#51** — Collection/Set icon edit affordance: icon is plumbed end-to-end but there is no user-facing way to set it (only via the `icon:` init param in code).
- **#44** — detail-view reactivity tests (`PageCollectionDetailView` + siblings); the reactivity fix shipped without view-level tests.
- **#43** — surface `SelectionCheckmark` in the Component Library (ChipsGallery).
- **#38** property-delete throws `PageTypeManagerError` toast · **#40** relabel Topic "parents" → "Spaces" (tier-1 label) in detail/supporting text.
- **Item Windows** — build the real Item Window (the editors are built to host it). **Page Previews** — standalone PreviewWindow primitive.
- **Latent (code-review):** `IndexUpdater.upsert{Page,Item}Collection` hardcode `schema_version = 1` instead of binding the entity's value (harmless now — collections read schemaVersion from the sidecar, not the index).

#### Fix Log

Acknowledged, not-yet-fixed — address soon (`/handoff` keeps this current):

1. **Icon picker too large.** The icon picker in View Settings renders far too big; constrain its size.
2. **Settings popout sizing.** The View Settings popout should size to its content dynamically to avoid scrolling (currently pinned to a fixed max height; Nathan likes the min height).
3. **Column reorder broken.** Drag-reordering table columns doesn't work.
4. **"Modified" not hideable.** Last-Edited / "Modified" can't be toggled off in the visibility settings, but it should be.
5. **Inline-edit lag.** Editing a property value inline has a noticeable performance + update buffer.
6. **Column layout not persisted.** Table column width/order adjustments don't survive across sessions (also: property columns don't show their icons).
7. **Handoff Skill.** Nathan wants an actual skill / command to handle the handoff process rather than relying on listed rules or per-session judgement.
8. **Relation-add dead-end in legacy sheets.** Picking "Relation" in the Vault/Type Settings sheets (context-menu schema editors) silently cancels — relations are created via the View Settings popover editor. Hide the Relation option there (or route it to the editor) so it isn't a no-op.

#### Maintained via `/handoff`
