### Pommora — Session Handoff

#### Current State

Domain model locked: three top-level entities — **Pages** (Markdown files), **Collections** (folder + `_collection.json` schema + `_items.json` items sidecar), **Spaces** (`.space.json` block trees) — plus **Items**, the Collection-bound row-shaped member type for entries that don't warrant a full Page. Per-entity feature specs live in `// Features//Pages.md`, `// Features//Collections.md`, `// Features//Items.md` (brief), `// Features//Spaces.md`.

Architecture framing is **conceptual portability of functionalities** — file formats, schemas, semantic operations, design tokens, and UX patterns survive a stack rebuild; the codebase doesn't. No enforced layer separation; the portability comes from documented decisions, not code structure.

Both stack paths (React+Electron and SwiftUI) are fully audited. Per-stack deep references in `ReactInfo.md` and `SwiftInfo.md` are parallel-structured for direct comparison; `Resources.md` catalogs external libraries per stack. The PRD's dual-stack table summarizes the side-by-side.

No code yet — `.claude//` contains project specs only.

#### Immediate Decisions

1. **Stack** — React+Electron or SwiftUI. **Gating decision for everything else.** All research is in: `ReactInfo.md`, `SwiftInfo.md`, the PRD dual-stack table, and `History.md`'s editor section. The mirror-image tradeoff: React makes the editor easy and Mac integration ~80%; SwiftUI makes Mac integration 100% and Phase B editor a real R&D project.

2. **Project license** — what Pommora ships under (MIT, Apache, GPL-3.0). Affects the React path specifically: BlockNote's `xl-multi-column` is GPL-3.0 viral OR $195/mo commercial. A permissive license means custom multi-column block in BlockNote core; GPL-3.0 means `xl-multi-column` is fine. Independent of but coupled to the stack call.

---

#### Immediate Explorations

- **Figma file setup** — design system foundations (colors, typography, spacing, three-pane shell components). Stack-agnostic at the token level; can run parallel to the stack decision. Use `figma-use` skill.

- **Audit findings to commit or defer** — `chokidar` → `@parcel/watcher`, `@dnd-kit/core` v6 pin, Zod validation + atomic writes + ULID per block, FTS5 `unicode61` mode, journal files for crash safety, `gray-matter` alternatives. Currently captured as findings, not committed. Decide which to lock in once the stack lands.

- **Spike before commit (optional)** — if the stack call wants empirical validation before locking: spike BlockNote markdown round-trip with a custom serializer for `:::columns`, OR spike SwiftUI `TextEditor` segment-based render to size the cross-segment cursor problem. Either spike is bounded; neither is required.

---

#### Open Questions

- **Stack:** React+Electron or SwiftUI?

- **License:** what does Pommora ship under?

- **Design (lower priority):** Figma file location and naming; default font choice (system stack vs opinionated); shell layout proportions (sidebar 240px, inspector 280px proposed in v0.0).

#### Recent Changes (this session)

- **Items entity added.** Collections now host two member types — Pages (Markdown files, prose-bearing) and Items (JSON entries in `_items.json` alongside `_collection.json`, row-shaped, no Markdown body). Items solve the Notion problem where wishlist entries and life domains are both full Pages. Same property catalog as Pages; same view participation; relations by ID, rename-safe. Items have no loose form — they only exist inside a Collection. Brief feature spec at `// Features//Items.md`; on-disk shape in `Collections.md`; entity table updated in `Domain-Model.md`; storage tree updated in `PommoraPRD.md`.

- **Persistent immediate legibility for agents articulated as the third load-bearing constraint.** Sibling to stack-portability and cross-vault-queryability + cloud-sync-compatibility. The project's central differentiator from Notion-via-MCP: Notion's MCP is tool-mediated (every relation traversal is an API round-trip; the workspace is opaque until queried); Obsidian is locally legible but unstructured; Pommora is the intersection — Notion-grade structure expressed in files an agent can read continuously without tool calls. Codified in PRD ("Persistent Immediate Legibility for Agents" section), CLAUDE.md core principles, Architecture.md ("agent legibility contract" in what-survives + practical-discipline lists), and Domain-Model.md resolved decisions.

- **"Files are canonical" clarified to mean "every entity is a file an external tool can open," not "everything is Markdown."** Pages → `.md`; Collections → folder + `_collection.json` + `_items.json`; Spaces → `.space.json`; Items → JSON entries in `_items.json`. SQLite remains regeneratable index. CLAUDE.md core principles updated.

- **Spaces sharpened as referential, not containers.** A Space's `.space.json` doesn't *hold* Pages or Items — it embeds them via `@view` directives, linked-pages widgets, and link lists. The framing was implicit; now explicit in `Spaces.md` and in the Domain-Model entity table.

- **Per-entity feature docs created.** Pages, Collections, and Spaces each got a dedicated detail doc in `// Features//` (`Pages.md`, `Collections.md`, `Spaces.md`). `Domain-Model.md` trimmed to a brief overview that links to the per-entity files plus retains cross-cutting topics (linking model, properties summary, sidebar, resolved decisions). PRD and CLAUDE.md Document Map updated to point to the new structure.

- **Phase B Swift editor reframed as committed post-v1 core feature.** Was previously framed ambiguously (in-scope for SwiftUI path); now explicitly: Phase A = v1 (native `TextEditor` + quick fork for H4-H6 + toggles); Phase B = committed post-v1 (full custom editor with hover-on-selection bubble toolbar). Phase B is a must-have eventually for the Swift path, not Prospects. Captured in `Pages.md`, `SwiftInfo.md`, and `History.md`.

- **Architecture simplified.** Dropped the three-layer enforcement model (Core / Adapter / UI separation rules; "Core has zero UI imports" rule) as over-engineered for indie development. New framing: **conceptual portability of functionalities** — file formats, SQLite schema, domain model, property catalog, directive syntax, wikilink behavior, view directives, design tokens, and UX patterns are designed to survive a stack rebuild. The codebase isn't pre-arranged for hot-swap; portability comes from documented decisions, not enforced code structure.

- **Files reorganized.** `Resources.md`, `ReactInfo.md`, `SwiftInfo.md` moved from `// Features//` to `.claude/` top level — they're cross-stack reference catalogs, not per-entity feature specs. All path references across the project updated.

- **Doc-convention restructure landed.** Introduced a `**For React**` / `**For Swift**` labeling convention within shared docs (PRD, Architecture, Domain-Model, Prospects, UIX-Guide) so stack-conditional content is visibly distinct. Created `// ReactInfo.md` as parallel to `SwiftInfo.md` (mirror structure section-for-section). Convention + exceptions (comparison tables, catalogs, stack-locked specs) documented in `CLAUDE.md`'s Document Map. Fixed long-standing `UIX-Guide.md` path discrepancy in CLAUDE.md / PRD / Architecture (file lives in `// Guidelines//`, not `// Features//`).

- **Research cycle 2 — tools and considerations dive.** Four parallel agents covered build/distribution, Mac OS integrations, editor internals, and state/data layer for both stacks. Findings landed in `Resources.md` and `SwiftInfo.md`. Key reads:
  - **Distribution is a wash.** Both stacks ship cleanly to MAS (security-scoped bookmarks pattern is identical) and have production-grade auto-update (electron-updater / Sparkle 2.x). React edges on dev loop (electron-vite HMR); SwiftUI edges on first-party tooling.
  - **Mac OS integrations lean materially toward SwiftUI.** QuickLook (.md preview via Finder spacebar), Share Extensions, CoreSpotlight, Finder file-promise drag-out, sidebar vibrancy, and accessibility all show meaningful gaps in pure Electron. Equal: app menu, deep links, basic notifications, dark-mode toggling.
  - **SwiftUI editor segment-render is the load-bearing risk.** No shipped Mac app uses the segment-based pattern Pommora's plan calls for; Bear / iA Writer / Craft all use single-text-view-with-decorations to avoid the cross-segment cursor problem. Mitigations: treat per-segment selection as a feature (Notion-like), or drop down to STTextView if cross-segment becomes a hard requirement.
  - **BlockNote markdown is lossy by design** (now confirmed in official docs). Custom serialization is achievable via per-block `toExternalHTML`/markdown handlers, but covering every block type *is* the canonical-format guarantee — not a small layer on top.
  - **State + data patterns confirmed for both stacks.** React: Zustand vanilla (Core) + hand-rolled table-keyed pub/sub (~80 LOC, ports to Swift) + better-sqlite3 + FTS5 (`unicode61`) + @parcel/watcher v2.5+. SwiftUI: `@Observable` + GRDB.swift v7.5+ + `ValueObservation` + FSEventStream wrapper. SwiftData remains unsafe for "files canonical" use cases.

- **Property catalog refined** — no free-form text property; title is the filename; "text-shaped" values use Select / Multi-select with creatable options (Notion behavior). `// Features//Properties.md` updated.

- **Callouts spec locked** — visual container with optional color, no icons or semantic types, single design pattern, composes with `@Columns` for side-by-side. PRD + Domain-Model + History updated.

- **Columns spec locked** — equidistant width division by child count in v1; no per-column width config (no inline attrs, no sidecar layout file). Adjustable widths deferred. PRD + Domain-Model + History updated.

- **Spaces framing clarified** — page-like canvas with drag-and-drop blocks, Notion-style structured layout (1D vertical flow with one nestable `columns` container), not free X/Y positioning.

- **Cloud-sync mapping fixed in PRD** — corrected from "each Collection → one cloud table" to "shared `pages` table with `collection_id + properties JSONB`" (matches local SQLite shape and Notion / Airtable / AFFiNE convention). It's a prospective feature, not currently in-scope.

- **Editor evaluation (React path) logged** — BlockNote vs Tiptap vs Milkdown vs Yoopta researched in depth. Nathan's call: BlockNote (open-source core); alternatives stay as pivot doors. See `History.md`.

- **SwiftUI editor strategy locked** — two-phase. Phase A: native `TextEditor<AttributedString>` with quick fork to add H4-H6 and toggles; would be implemented in 1-2 days. Phase B: full custom editor with hover-on-selection bubble toolbar (Medium/Notion-style). Segment-based render handles callouts and columns; would be added once the apps core features are solidified. Captured in `// SwiftInfo.md`.

- **Toggles added as v1 Pages feature** — collapsible content blocks (Notion-style). Joins `@Columns` and callouts as the third Page block-level feature; added natively with React editors, would be quickly added during Phase A if Swift.

- **SwiftUI exploration completed** — Interactful clarified as a reference app (not a library). Spaces viable in pure SwiftUI (`visfitness/reorderable` + `stevengharris/SplitView`).

- **Resources.md populated** — library references for both React and SwiftUI paths, plus the editor evaluation links.
