## History — Pommora React

Decisions + what shipped. Brief, not a work log.

### Project genesis (2026-06-14)

Spun up from the Swift project's React-rebuild exploration. Scope locked to the "core 7" (data · properties · connections · markdown · navigation · table · gallery); on-disk format modernized TS-native; built/tested against a test nexus at `~/test`. Two research workflows (Swift→React portability assessment + library/toolkit dual-look) back the roadmap.

### Phase 1 — Window + glass sidebar skeleton ✅

Read-only walking skeleton: `readNexus` (sidecar + structure-classification paths, lenient frontmatter, roll-up, stable adopted ids, ordering) → IPC `nexus:open` → Zustand store → recursive glass sidebar reading `~/test`. 15 vitest tests; typecheck + build green. Adversarially reviewed (read engine verified against the real `~/test`).

Key commits: `823ee65` skeleton · `50e37c5` CommonJS main/preload + sandbox + README · `ee616a0`…`de79a93` glass iterations.

### Locked decisions

- **CommonJS main/preload** (not `type: module`) — ESM `require('electron')` named imports fail at runtime; CJS also keeps the preload sandboxable.
- **`sandbox: true` + `contextIsolation: true` + `nodeIntegration: false`.**
- **No SQLite on the read path** — a single fs walk is the source (proven against the Swift sidebar's own behavior); SQLite returns later only as a regeneratable query accelerator.
- **Title-fallback ordering for adopted entities** (hash ids aren't meaningful order); ULID-id fallback for sidecar entities.
- **Vite 7 + plugin-react 5 pin** (newer plugin-react needs Vite 8, unsupported by electron-vite 5).
- **Glass:** Apple-Regular CSS, edge-defined (no body brightness/white fill). `liquid-dom` (WebGPU) evaluated and shelved (experimental flag + invasive).

### Phase 2 — Navigation function + views 🔬 in progress

Build workflow (sequential, self-verified): page-open IPC (path-traversal-guarded) · selection → detail routing · pure view pipeline · Table (TanStack) + Gallery renderers · read-only page render (react-markdown) · view switcher. Read-only; write/CRUD/editor/properties/connections deferred. (Update with the landing commit + outcome.)
